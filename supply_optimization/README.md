# Ride-Hailing Demand Prediction Task

![Description of the image](Designer.jpeg)

## Problem

In a ride-hailing marketplace, efficient supply-demand matching is critical. The challenge here is to guide drivers toward high-demand areas, ensuring that riders get timely rides and drivers maintain steady earnings. Understanding demand fluctuations across time and location is key to optimizing this system.

## Project Objective

The main objectives of this project are to:

- Analyze data and propose a solution to guide drivers to high-demand areas.
- Build and document a baseline demand prediction model.
- Outline deployment and model communication strategies for drivers.
- Design an experiment to validate the solutionâ€™s impact in real operations.

## Data Overview

The dataset contains approximately 630,000 rows of synthetic demand data, representing ride requests in Tallinn. The data includes the following features:

- **start_time**: Order timestamp
- **start_lat**: Pickup location latitude
- **start_lng**: Pickup location longitude
- **end_lat**: Destination location latitude
- **end_lng**: Destination location longitude
- **ride_value**: Value of the ride (EUR)
